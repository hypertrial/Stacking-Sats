    - wallet (dict): Current wallet balances with keys &#x27;usd&#x27; and &#x27;btc&#x27;
    - historical_data (dict, optional): Historical price data if available
    
    Returns:

    # Simple strategy: allocate $250 per week (standard DCA)
    # This passes validation but you should replace with your own strategy
    
    allocation = 250.0
    
    # Ensure allocation is within valid range (0-1000)
    allocation = max(0, min(allocation, 1000))
    
    return allocation
