# Stacking-Sats  
Resources for Hypertrialâ€™s Stacking Sats Challenge

## ðŸ§  Challenge Overview  

Youâ€™ve been orange-pilled. Your mission? Stack as many sats as possible.  

Most Bitcoiners rely on Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)â€”investing a fixed amount at regular intervals. It's simple, reduces timing risk, and avoids emotional investing. But is it optimal?  

In this challenge, youâ€™ll go beyond static DCA to design *dynamic accumulation strategies* that aim to maximize Bitcoin holdings while keeping DCAâ€™s core strengths. Your goal is to refine your approach and build intuition around Bitcoinâ€™s unique structure.

## ðŸ“˜ Tutorials  

Before you dive in, we recommend completing the following notebooks:

1. `Intro.ipynb` â€“ Why DCA isnâ€™t enough: improving Bitcoin accumulation strategies  
2. `Formal_Problem_Statement.ipynb` â€“ Understand the rules, goals, and evaluation criteria  
3. `Submission_Template.ipynb` â€“ How to format and submit your solution  
4. `Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb` â€“ Explore Bitcoinâ€™s structural properties to inform your strategy
