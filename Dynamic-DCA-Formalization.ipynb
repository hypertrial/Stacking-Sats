    "Concretely, for cycle $t$ we compute a feature vector $\\mathbf x^{(t)}$ and produce weights\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why formalize rules this way?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminates cherry‑picking.**  \n",
    "   Every allocation comes from the same mapping $f$, not hand‑picked for specific dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduces overfitting.**  \n",
    "   Constraining $f$ to a parameterized function class (e.g. linear, tree, neural) allows tuning via cross‑validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enables reproducibility and fair comparison.**  \n",
    "   All strategies inhabit the same convex feasible region ($\\mathrm{int}\\,\\Delta^{n-1}$). Performance differences arise solely from feature design and model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advances understanding of Bitcoin.**  \n",
    "   Systematic out‑of‑sample testing reveals which structural characteristics (volatility clustering, mean‑reversion, tail events) truly improve DCA outcomes."
