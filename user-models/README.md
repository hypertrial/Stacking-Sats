# Hypertrial User Models
      
## Overview
This directory contains Bitcoin accumulation strategies submitted by users through the Hypertrial platform's Stacking Sats Challenge.

## Directory Structure
Each user's models are stored in a subdirectory named after a shortened version of their wallet address. This helps organize the models while maintaining user privacy.

## Model Format
Each model is a Python function that implements a Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. The models take the current market conditions as input and output how much USD to spend on Bitcoin.

## Contributing
These models are automatically uploaded when users submit their strategies through the Hypertrial platform. Direct contributions to this repository are not accepted.

## License
All models in this repository are subject to the MIT License as specified in the repository's root LICENSE file.
